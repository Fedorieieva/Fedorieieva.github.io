                the animals to socializing them and finding them homes.

              <h3>Our History</h3>
              <p>
                Our shelter was founded in 1990 by a group of animal lovers who
                were concerned about the number of homeless pets in our
                community. We started out as a small operation, but we have
                grown over the years to become one of the largest pet shelters
                in the area.
              </p>
              <h3>Our Goals</h3>
              <p>
                Our goal is to find loving homes for all of the animals in our
                care. We also want to educate the public about the importance of
                spaying and neutering their pets and about the benefits of
                adopting a pet from a shelter.
